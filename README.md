## 🚀 How It Works

1.	When the program starts, a window appears displaying the current time.
2.	The time is updated every second using a QTimer.
3.	The time is displayed in a visually appealing style:
   
	  •	Large green text (font-size: 150px) on a black background.
  	
	  •	Center-aligned for a clean look.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

•	Add an alarm feature with custom sound notifications.

•	Provide options to change time format (e.g., 24-hour vs. 12-hour).

•	Allow users to customize font color, size, and background.
